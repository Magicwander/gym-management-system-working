## Major Fixes Applied

### 1. AccountController.php Fixes
- **Issue**: Non-existent Trainer model being imported and used
- **Fix**: Removed Trainer model import, updated all trainer methods to use User model

  - `Trainer::create()` → `User::create()`
  - `Trainer::latest()` → `User::where('role', 'trainer')->latest()`
  - Method signatures updated from `Trainer $trainer` to `User $trainer`

### 2. Route Reference Fixes
- **Issue**: Views using incorrect route names (admin.trainers.* vs admin.accounts.trainers.*)
- **Fix**: Updated all view files with correct route references
- **Files Updated**: All member and trainer view files

### 3. Model Relationship Fixes
- **Issue**: Missing Membership model and incorrect foreign key references
- **Fix**: Created Membership model, fixed User model relationships
- **Changes**: Added proper foreign key mappings (user_id vs member_id)

### 4. Workout Route Issues
- **Issue**: Trainer views referencing non-existent workout routes
- **Fix**: Commented out workout-related links in trainer show view
- **Note**: Workout functionality needs separate implementation
